# meeting-scribe-rules

Using a d20, our team uses these rules to determine who needs to act as scribe for a meeting.

## Motivation
Let's face it - being tasked with taking notes for a meeting is a task no one wants. Sure, you could create a schedule for scribing and hopefully someone will remember to look at it before the meeting, but what fun is that? "One, two, three ... NOT IT!!!" doesn't work once your team gets large enough. Since many of us are gamers (including RPGs), we use a d20 to determine the lucky person.

## Requirements
Each person should have their own d20; upon joining our team, each person is given one and it is his/her responsibility to keep it safe. Messing with another person's d20 is frowned upon, so we mostly need to keep it from falling off our desks. Taking it home is also not a good idea, as these rules can be called upon for impromptu meetings from time to time. Also, the scribe keeps track of the rolls from meeting to meeting (we post ours in a wiki). The only other thing needed is these rules.

## The Rules
As with any role playing game, we roll and apply modifiers. General RPG dice rolling rules apply:
* rolling a 20 is a *critical hit*
* rolling a 1 is a *critical miss*
* if there are tied rolls (i.e., the result of a roll + modifier), the highest modifier wins
* if there are tied rolls and tied modifiers, a re-roll is required
* a replacement die can be purchased for $1 (or one can be brought from home, subject to approval/testing)

### Additional rules that we have:
* modifiers stack up until used
* if you forgot your die, you *must* go retrieve it before the roll; note that you risk being the last person in
* the scribe for the current meeting *must* keep track of modifiers
* whether or not a tardy/absence is considered _excused_ is up to the discretion of the team manager (and can be done after-the-fact)

### Definitions of terms
|term|definition|
|----|----------|
|excused absence|you are absent and team manager has approved|
|unexcused absense|you are absent and _do not_ have team manager approval|
|excused tardy|you miss the roll-off but attend the meeting and team manager has approved|
|unexcused tardy|you miss the roll-off but attend the meeting and _do not_ team manager has approved|

### The modifiers
| condition | modifier |
|-----------|:--------:|
|it is your first team meeting|+15|
|you are the team manager|+12|
|you are presenting an _approved_ topic|+10|
|you scribed the last X team meetings|+(X * 5)|
|you are the last one in the room and participate in the rolling|-1|
|you forgot your die|-1|
|you lost your die|-10|
|you failed to acquire your die before your first meeting|-10 (see below)|
|you need to borrow materials (pencil, paper, etc.)|-2|
|excused tardy or absent for the past X team meetings|-(X * 2)|
|you roll using an app on your phone and not a die|-4|
|you scribed last meeting but forgot to note modifiers|-4|
|unexcused tardy or absent for the past X team meetings|-(X * 5)|
|you profess that these rules and/or this concept is stupid|-15|
|you are supposed to scribe but are unable to (injury, etc.)|ongoing -20 until you are able to scribe|

_On our team, there is some debate about the condition "you failed to acquire your die before your first meeting"; as written, it implies that the team member without a die receives the modifier. Some feel that the modifier should go to the person responsible for handing them out._

## Scenario
1. a team meeting is scheduled at 9:00AM and everyone attends on time; no modifiers
2. Alice is the last person in the door: she gets a -1 modifier
3. Bob is absent but had a doctor appointment (team manager approves): he gets a -1 modifier
4. Charlie is stuck in traffic; at 8:45AM he calls the team manager and tells him. The manager can excuse the tardiness (in which case he gets a -1 modifier), but if the manager does _not_ excuse the tardiness, Charlie gets a -5 modifier.
5. Diane comes in at 9:01AM. This means that Alice is no longer the last person in and her modifier is removed. Diane is now the last person in and receives a -1 modifier.
6. Edward realizes he forgot his die, so he goes to retrieve it. When he comes back in at 9:02AM, he is now the last person in. Diane's modifier is removed, and Edward receives the -1.
7. Each person rolls. Frankie rolled the only 1, so she is chosen as scribe.
8. Greg walks in at 9:03AM, _after the roll_. He was helping a customer, and the manager approves his tardiness. He receives a -1 modifier _for the next roll_
9. Harriet walks in at 9:04AM, _after the roll_  because she was making herself an espresso. The manager does _not_ approve her tardiness, so she receives a -5 modifiere _for the next roll_
10. Ivan forgot about the meeting and doesn't attend. This is an unexcused absense, so he receives a -5 modifier _for the next roll_

## Results of using this method
* everyone has a little bit of fun (and bonus, we each have a d20 on our desks to help us determine our life choices)
* team meetings have high attendance
* people show up _before the meeting starts_
* meetings notes are always promptly posted to the wiki
* more people have presented topics than might have otherwise
